# Hangman Game - GUI Edition  

This is a graphical version of the classic Hangman game built using Python and Tkinter. The game selects a random animal name, and the player must guess the word letter by letter before running out of lives.  

## Features  
- Interactive graphical interface  
- Letter buttons for easy guessing  
- Visual hangman progression  
- "Play Again" option to restart the game  

## How to Play  
1. Click on letters to guess the hidden word.  
2. Each incorrect guess reduces the number of lives.  
3. The game ends when you either guess the word correctly or run out of lives.  
4. Click "Play Again" to start a new round.  

This project provides a simple and engaging way to play Hangman with an improved user experience.
